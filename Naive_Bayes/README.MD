In this study, it is analyzed whether the headlines obtained from various sites are sarcastic or not. Naive Bayes is a simple "probabilistic classifiers" and based on Bayes theorem. It can be expressed as: \begin{equation} P(c/x) = \frac{ P(x/c) P(c)}{P(x)} \end{equation*}

* P(c) = Prior probabilty
* P(x/c) = Likelihood
* P(c/x) = Posterior probability
It is assumed that all the features have an equal effect on the outcome and features has unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
