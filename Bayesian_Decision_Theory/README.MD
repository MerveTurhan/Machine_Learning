What is Bayesian?
* It is one of the parametric methods. So we assume that it comes from a distribution of dataset we have.
* Based on this assumption, it allows creating a model by knowing a limited number of parameters in the sample.
* Assuming that the data we have is from Gauss, the parameter required to create a model is only average and variance.
* Let's say we have two different datasets. Assuming that these datasets come from gauss, our model is formed when we calculate the mean and standard deviations of the dataset.
