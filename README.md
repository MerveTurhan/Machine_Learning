# Machine_Learning

As known; there are a lot of frameworks for machine learning applications. With Using them model can be created in a short time. In addition to creating models, it is also important to get into the depth of algorithms. If we learn the matematical background of machine learning algorithms, we can also improve the new innovative algorithms.
Check my Kaggle account and learn the algorithm details.
